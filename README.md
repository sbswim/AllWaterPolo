<h1> Why is it being Made? </h1>
AllWaterPolo is being constructed in order to promote the sport of water polo and to promote a healthy positive life. Although the site is targeted more toward the youth, anyone of any age could learn a little something from just stopping by.

<h1> How it is being made? </h1>
As of now, it is being made by just me. I would like it to expand as people visit this repo, but until then, I'll keep coding it.

<h2> Thanks to all! </h2>
