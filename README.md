<h1> Why is it being Made? </h1>
AllWaterPolo is being constructed in order to promote the sport of water polo and to promote a healthy positive life.  Not only will athletes and people learn to live a heathy life, but will also learn about preventing injuries, the sport itself, and proper way to train in order to improve the right way. Although the site is targeted more toward the youth, anyone of any age could learn a little something from just stopping by.

<h1> How it is being made? </h1>
As of now, it is being made by just me. I would like it to expand as people visit this repo, but until then, I'll keep coding it.

<h2> Thanks to all! </h2>
